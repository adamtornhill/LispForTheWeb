;; Domain model
;; ============

;; A simple domain model of our games together with
;; access methods.

(defclass game ()
  ((name  :reader   name 
          :initarg  :name)
   (votes :accessor votes 
          :initform 0)))

;; By default the printed representation of CLOS objects isn't
;; particularly informative to a human. We can override the default
;; behaviour by specializing the generic function
;; print-object for our game (print-unreadable-object is
;; just a standard macro that helps us with the stream set-up
;; and display of type information).
(defmethod print-object ((object game) stream)
  (print-unreadable-object (object stream :type t)
    (with-slots (name votes) object
      (format stream "name: ~s with ~d votes" name votes))))

(defmethod vote-for (game)
  (incf (votes game)))

;; Backend
;; =======

;; A prototypic backend that stores all games in
;; a list. Later, we'll move to a persistent storage and
;; only need to modify these accessor functions:

(defvar *games* '())

;; We encapsulate all knowledge of the concrete storage
;; medium in the following functions:

(defun game-from-name (name)
  (find name *games* :test #'string-equal :key  #'name))

(defun game-stored? (game-name)
  (game-from-name game-name))

(defun games ()
  (sort (copy-list *games*) #'> :key #'votes))

(defun add-game (name)
  (unless (game-stored? name)
    (push (make-instance 'game :name name) *games*)))

;; Web Server - Hunchentoot

(defun start-server (port)
  (hunchentoot:start (make-instance 'hunchentoot:easy-acceptor :port port)))

(defun publish-static-content ()
  (push (create-static-file-dispatcher-and-handler

  (push (create-static-file-dispatcher-and-handler
         "/retro.css" "static/retro.css") *dispatch-table*))

;; DSL for our web pages
;; =====================

;; Here we grow a small domain-specific language for
;; creating dynamic web pages.

; Control the cl-who output format (default is XHTML, we 
; want HTML5):
(setf (html-mode) :html5)

;; This is the initial version of our standard page template.
;; We'll evolve it later in the tutorial, making it accept
;; scripts as well (used to inject JavaScript for validation
;; into the HTML header).
