;; ============

;; A simple domain model of our games together with

;; By default the printed representation of CLOS objects isn't
;; particularly informative to a human. We can override the default
;; behaviour by specializing the generic function
;; print-object for our game (print-unreadable-object is
;; just a standard macro that helps us with the stream set-up
;; and display of type information).

;; Backend
;; =======

;; Pre-requisite: a mongod daemon process runs on localhost
;; using the default port.
;; Here we establish a connection to the database games that
;; we'll use for all storage:
(cl-mongo:db.use "games")

;; We store all game documents in the following collection:
(defparameter *game-collection* "game")

;; We encapsulate all knowledge of the concrete storage
;; medium in the following functions:

(defun game->doc (game)
  ($ ($ "name" (name game))
     ($ "votes" (votes game))))

(defun doc->game (game-doc)
  (make-instance 'game :name (get-element "name" game-doc)
                       :votes (get-element "votes" game-doc)))

(defmethod vote-for :after (game)
  "In this method we update the votes in the persistent storage.
   An after method in CLOS gives us an Observer-like behaviour;
   once the primary method has run, CLOS invokes our after method."
  (let ((game-doc (game->doc game)))
    (db.update *game-collection* ($ "name" (name game)) game-doc)))

(defun game-from-name (name)
  "Queries the database for a game matching the
   given name.
   Note that db.find behaves like Mongo's findOne by default, so
   when we found-games we know there can be only one."
  (let ((found-games (docs (db.find *game-collection* ($ "name" name)))))
    (when found-games
      (doc->game (first found-games)))))

(defun game-stored? (name)
  (game-from-name name))

(defun games ()
  "Returns a sequence of all games, sorted on
   their number of votes in descending order.
   The implementation is straightforwards since
   cl-mongo provides a db.sort macro. We just need
   to remember that we get a lazy sequence back and
   have to realize it (iterate to the end) using iter."
  (mapcar #'doc->game
          (docs (iter (db.sort *game-collection* :all
                                                 :field "votes"
                                                 :asc nil)))))

                   ($ field 1)
                   :unique t))

;; We want to avoid duplicates. In the current version with
;; a limited domain model, the name alone is used for uniqueness.
;; As we evolve the domain we probably want to modify this constraint too.
(unique-index-on "name")

(defun add-game (name)
  "Add a game with the given name to the database.
   In this version we don't check for duplicates."
  (let ((game (make-instance 'game :name name)))
    (db.insert *game-collection* (game->doc game))))

;; Web Server - Hunchentoot

;; DSL for our web pages
;; =====================

;; Here we grow a small domain-specific language for
;; creating dynamic web pages.

; Control the cl-who output format (default is XHTML, we 
; want HTML5):
